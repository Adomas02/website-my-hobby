        <h1>Hiking</h1>
        <p>
            Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for pleasure
            developed in Europe during the eighteenth century. Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but they
            involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.

                <h3>Hiking shoe</h3>
                <p>Hiking (walking) boots are footwear specifically designed for protecting the feet and ankles during
                    outdoor walking activities such as hiking. They are one of the most important items of hiking gear,
                    since their quality and durability can determine a hiker's ability to walk long distances without
                    injury.</p>
